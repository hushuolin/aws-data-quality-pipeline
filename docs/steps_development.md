# Steps to Develop the Fintech Data Quality Assurance Pipeline

This document outlines the specific steps required to successfully develop the fintech data quality assurance pipeline based on the architectural design and requirements analysis.

## Step 1: Requirements Analysis
- **Define Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**: Gather all data quality requirements, such as data integrity, compliance, and scalability.
- **Identify Data Quality Metrics**: Define key metrics and business rules for the data quality assurance of the fintech transaction data.
- **Use Case Definition**: Establish the use cases for data ingestion, validation, schema detection, alerting, and logging.

## Step 2: System Design
- **Define System Architecture**: Establish the architecture based on AWS services including Glue, Lambda, SNS, EventBridge, and S3.
- **Design Workflows**: Design data ingestion, validation, alerting, and logging workflows using architecture diagrams to illustrate the complete flow.
- **Component Selection**: Choose AWS services to ensure high availability, scalability, and low maintenance of the pipeline.

## Step 3: Setup and Configuration of AWS Infrastructure
1. **Create S3 Buckets**:
   - **S3 Bucket A** for raw transaction data storage.
   - **S3 Bucket C** for logging validation results and compliance-related activities.
   - **S3 Bucket B** for processed data storage.

2. **AWS Glue Crawler and Glue Data Catalog**:
   - Configure Glue Crawler to crawl **S3 Bucket A** and extract metadata.
   - Update **Glue Data Catalog** to maintain up-to-date schema information.

3. **AWS Glue Jobs**:
   - Write Glue scripts to validate schema conformity, data types, and cross-field relationships.
   - Schedule Glue Jobs based on data ingestion events or time-based triggers.

4. **AWS Lambda Functions**:
   - Create Lambda functions to process schema change events, handle validation issues, and trigger alerts.
   - Configure retry mechanisms for transient errors.

5. **AWS EventBridge**:
   - Set up rules to capture schema changes and validation events.
   - Route critical events to **AWS Lambda** for further processing.

6. **AWS SNS Configuration**:
   - Create SNS topics for alerting data engineers and stakeholders.
   - Define escalation policies for unresolved issues.

## Step 4: Data Quality Validation Implementation
- **Develop Validation Scripts**: Implement validation logic, such as mandatory fields, data type checks, and cross-field consistency checks using AWS Glue.
- **Schema Detection**: Set up **AWS Glue Crawler** to periodically scan datasets for schema changes.
- **Unit Testing**: Test validation rules using sample datasets to ensure conformity with requirements.

## Step 5: Alerts and Monitoring Setup
- **Alert Setup Using AWS SNS**: Define alert channels and configure SNS for sending alerts via email or SMS.
- **Monitoring Using AWS CloudWatch**: Set up monitoring for Lambda execution, Glue job performance, and SNS alerts to ensure the system runs smoothly.
- **Define Escalation Rules**: Set up policies to notify senior stakeholders if alerts are not resolved within a predefined time frame.

## Step 6: Logging and Audit Configuration
- **Logging Setup**: Configure **AWS Lambda** and **Glue Jobs** to write logs to **S3 Bucket C** for auditing purposes.
- **Retention Policies**: Establish log retention policies to meet compliance requirements (e.g., 7-year retention).

## Step 7: Testing and Validation
1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Test each AWS component individually to verify its functionality.
   - Run data through the pipeline to validate end-to-end processing.

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test the pipeline with high-volume datasets to validate scalability.
   - Monitor Glue job and Lambda performance to detect potential bottlenecks.

3. **Compliance Testing**:
   - Test data encryption, access control, and logging for compliance with data protection standards.

## Step 8: Deployment and Optimization
- **Deployment to Production**: Deploy the pipeline in a production environment with monitoring and alerting enabled.
- **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Fine-tune Glue job execution, Lambda memory settings, and other parameters based on performance testing results.

## Step 9: Documentation and Handoff
- **Documentation**: Document the system architecture, workflow, and AWS configurations.
- **Training and Handoff**: Train data engineers on managing the pipeline, troubleshooting issues, and handling alerts.

## Summary
These steps provide a systematic approach to develop, configure, and deploy the fintech data quality assurance pipeline. By following these steps, the project ensures the robustness, reliability, and compliance of the data platform while managing data quality effectively.
