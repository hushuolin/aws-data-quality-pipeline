# Data Quality Requirements for Fintech Data Pipeline

This document outlines the data quality requirements for the fintech data pipeline. These requirements focus on schema validation, data consistency, data validity, scalability, error handling, and alerting to ensure the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of the pipeline.

## 1. Schema Validation Requirements

### **Objective**
Ensure all incoming datasets conform to the expected schema to maintain consistency and reliability in the data pipeline.

- **Mandatory Fields**:
  - Each record must contain the following fields: `Profile-ID`, `Consumer-ID`, `Customer-Name`, `Session-ID`, `Transaction-Reference`, `Transaction-Amount`, `Currency`, `Transaction-Type`, `Transaction-Status`, `Account-Number`, `Account-Balance`, `Merchant-ID`, `Merchant-Name`, `Fraud-Flag`, `Timestamp`.
  - Missing mandatory fields will trigger alerts and be logged for further action.

- **Field-Level Requirements**:
  - **Data Types**:
    - Fields like `Profile-ID`, `Consumer-ID`, `Session-ID`, and `Transaction-Reference` must be strings.
    - `Transaction-Amount` and `Account-Balance` must be numerical values (`float` or `decimal`).
    - `Timestamp` must be in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format.
  - **Validation Rules**:
    - `Transaction-Amount` must be greater than zero.
    - `Transaction-Status` must be one of the following: `Success`, `Failed`, `Pending`.

- **New and Removed Fields**:
  - **New Fields**: Any new fields added must be properly identified and documented.
  - **Missing Fields**: If mandatory fields are missing, the dataset will be flagged and logged, and processing will be paused.

## 2. Data Consistency Requirements

### **Objective**
Ensure data consistency across related fields and maintain integrity between different pieces of data.

- **Uniqueness Constraints**:
  - `Transaction-Reference` must be unique within each dataset. Duplicate references should trigger alerts.

- **Field Dependencies**:
  - For debit transactions (`Transaction-Type` is `Debit`), `Transaction-Amount` must be reflected in the `Account-Balance`.
  - If `Transaction-Status` is `Failed`, there should be no impact on `Account-Balance`.

- **Cross-Field Validation**:
  - `Merchant-ID` and `Merchant-Name` must always be consistent.

## 3. Data Validity Requirements

### **Objective**
Ensure each field contains valid data that conforms to expected formats and business logic.

- **Data Type Validity**:
  - **Invalid Data Types**: Fields like `Transaction-Amount` containing invalid values (e.g., `NaN`) must be flagged and logged.
  - **Empty Fields**: Mandatory fields should not contain empty values.

- **Business Logic Validation**:
  - **Transaction Amount**: Negative `Transaction-Amount` is only allowed for refund transactions.
  - **Fraud Handling**: If `Fraud-Flag` is marked `True`, the transaction must be flagged for additional review.

## 4. Data Scalability and Performance Requirements

### **Objective**
Ensure the data pipeline can handle high volumes of data while maintaining performance.

- **High-Volume Data Handling**:
  - The data pipeline must handle datasets with up to 100,000 records without performance degradation.

- **Processing Time Requirements**:
  - **Small Datasets**: Processing must complete within 1 minute for datasets up to 1,000 records.
  - **Large Datasets**: Processing must complete within 5 minutes for datasets of up to 100,000 records.

- **Logging and Monitoring**:
  - Log all errors, warnings, and significant changes, including validation issues.

## 5. Schema Change Detection and Alerting Requirements

### **Objective**
Detect changes in the incoming data schema and generate alerts for further analysis.

- **Schema Change Detection**:
  - AWS Glue Crawler should automatically detect changes in schema and update Glue Table metadata accordingly.

- **Notification System**:
  - All schema changes must trigger alerts, routed to the data engineering team via AWS SNS or email notifications.
  - Missing critical fields or unexpected fields must trigger high-priority alerts.

## 6. Error Handling and Alerting Requirements

### **Objective**
Define how errors are managed and communicated to stakeholders to maintain system reliability.

- **Logging**:
  - **Schema Errors**: Log all schema validation errors, including missing fields or mismatched data types.
  - **Validation Errors**: Record validation issues such as `NaN` in `Transaction-Amount` and generate alerts.

- **Alerting**:
  - **Immediate Alerts**: Generate alerts via AWS SNS or email for critical issues such as schema changes, validation failures, or duplicate transactions.
  - **Error Thresholds**: If errors exceed a defined threshold (e.g., 5% of records), trigger an escalation process.

## Summary
These data quality requirements ensure that the fintech data pipeline remains reliable, scalable, and compliant with business needs. They cover all aspects of data quality, including schema validation, data consistency, validity, scalability, schema change detection, error handling, and alerting.
