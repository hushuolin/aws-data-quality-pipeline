## S3 Buckets Configuration
### Data Security Requirements:
- **Encryption Type**: What type of encryption do you want to use for S3 buckets (e.g., server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) or default encryption)?
- **Access Restrictions**: Should access be restricted to specific IP ranges (e.g., VPN access only)?

### Access Management:
- **Access Control**: Who should have access to each bucket (e.g., specific IAM roles, cross-account access)?
- **Access Policy**: Do you need a detailed access policy for users or services accessing each bucket?

## AWS Glue Crawler and Glue Data Catalog
### Crawler Configuration:
- **Crawler Frequency**: What frequency should the crawler run (daily, hourly)?
- **Trigger Type**: Should the crawler run on a schedule or be triggered by specific events?

### Glue Data Catalog Metadata:
- **Metadata Requirements**: What metadata should be captured and used for validation? (e.g., data types, column names, data size, and data freshness)

## AWS Glue Jobs
### Resource Allocation:
- **Instance Types**: What instance types and worker nodes should be used for different workloads (e.g., Standard vs. G.1X vs. G.2X based on workload volume)?
- **Budget Considerations**: Are there any budget constraints or efficiency requirements to consider?

### Validation Logic:
- **Field Validation**: What specific validation rules should be implemented for each data field? (e.g., "Transaction-Amount" should always be a positive value)
- **Business Rules**: Should any specific business rules be enforced within the Glue jobs (e.g., Transaction-Type matches Transaction-Status)?

## AWS Lambda Functions
### Function Configuration:
- **Memory and Timeout**: What are the memory and timeout configurations for each Lambda function? (e.g., default memory or specific MB settings)
- **Retry Limits**: Should Lambda retries be capped at a certain number before escalating the issue?

### Environment Variables:
- **Configuration Needs**: Do you need environment variables for configuration, such as threshold limits for validation or SNS topic ARN for alerts?

## AWS EventBridge
### Event Capture Rules:
- **Event Selection**: Should all events be captured, or only critical ones (e.g., schema changes affecting mandatory fields)?
- **Filtering Criteria**: What filtering criteria should be used to determine which events trigger alerts or Lambda functions?

### Cross-Account Handling:
- **Event Forwarding**: Should event rules be configured to forward events to other accounts?
- **Security Requirements**: Are there any security requirements for cross-account event handling?

## AWS SNS Configuration
### Notification Channels:
- **Stakeholder Notification**: Who are the stakeholders to be notified, and how should alerts be prioritized (e.g., data engineers get high-priority notifications)?
- **Delivery Method**: Should messages be delivered via email, SMS, or both?

### Escalation Process:
- **Escalation Workflow**: If an alert is not addressed within a specific timeframe, who should be notified next?
- **Escalation Threshold**: What is the escalation threshold (e.g., 30 minutes without acknowledgment)?

## CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms
### Key Metrics:
- **Critical Metrics**: Which specific metrics are most critical to track? (e.g., Lambda execution duration, Glue job success rate, number of EventBridge triggers)
- **Thresholds**: Are there thresholds for these metrics (e.g., Glue job duration must not exceed 30 minutes)?

### Dashboard Requirements:
- **Custom Dashboards**: Should custom CloudWatch dashboards be created for monitoring specific metrics?
- **Access Level**: Should stakeholders have read-only access to these dashboards?

## Additional Questions for Configuration Details:
### Notification and Escalation Workflow:
- **Stakeholder Roles**: Who are the stakeholders involved at each stage of notification, and what are their specific roles and responsibilities?

### Security Compliance:
- **Compliance Requirements**: Are there any compliance requirements that need to be integrated into the configuration (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS)?

### Data Retention Policies:
- **Log Retention**: How long should logs in S3 Bucket C be retained before being archived or deleted?
